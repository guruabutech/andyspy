# andyspy
Android Spy App

This project was built using ahmedhannachi/nkframework coded by Me :D

This application can be installed in android mobile phones and it runs in background ;), and she is doing interessting things like :
Collecting all SMS message and sending them to the server using the API. ( Not really interessting ? :/ )
Recording all voices call & again sending files to the server. ( What about this feature ? :p )

The web app of the project is ready to use just upload it to server & configure (./index.php) your database using the andyspycdlmain.sql.

Until now we can't change the api URL in the mobile app because we do not have the Android Project source we haveonly the APK.
(If you have a proper way, HELP US :D )
