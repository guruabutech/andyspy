# andyspy
Android Spy App

This project was built using NkFrameWork.

The web app of the project is ready to use just upload it to server & configure (./index.php) your database using the andyspycdlmain.sql.

Until now we can't change the api URL in the mobile app because we do not have the Android Project source we haveonly the APK.
(If you have a proper way, HELP US :D )
